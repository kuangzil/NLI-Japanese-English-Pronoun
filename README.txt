Native Language Identification (NLI) Project
Project Overview
This project aims to distinguish between English texts written by native Japanese speakers and those written by native English speakers. The study falls under the domain of Native Language Identification (NLI), a subfield of computational linguistics. The goal is to extract linguistic features that can help identify whether a text was generated by a native speaker of English or a non-native speaker, specifically focusing on Japanese learners of English.

Objective
The main objective is to develop a classification model that can differentiate between English texts based on the author’s native language. The primary features used for this identification include pronouns, anaphora, and other textual elements such as third-person pronouns and possessive determiners.

Key Features:
Third-Person Pronouns: "he," "she," "it" (typically more frequent in native English speakers' text)
Demonstratives: Japanese native speakers may use expressions like "that person" instead of specific pronouns.
Possessive Determiners: Differences in the use of "his," "her," "their," and related possessive constructions.
Current Progress
Corpus:

Using the JLE-NICT (Japanese Learner English Corpus by NICT) as the main dataset for analysis. This corpus contains English texts written by Japanese learners of English, providing rich data for NLI tasks.
The dataset is used to create training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance in distinguishing between native English speakers and Japanese learners of English.
Feature Extraction:

Texts are vectorized using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to capture the importance of certain words across the corpus.
A log10 transformation was applied to the TF-IDF data to normalize the feature distribution and improve model performance.
T-tests were conducted to validate initial hypotheses regarding significant differences in pronoun usage between native English speakers and Japanese learners of English, and the results confirmed these differences.
Dimensionality Reduction (Upcoming):

The next step involves applying dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to group and classify different types of pronouns. This will simplify the feature space and help in analyzing patterns more effectively.
Modeling and Classification (Upcoming):

After dimensionality reduction, classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) will be used to train the model and classify texts based on pronoun usage and other linguistic features.
The goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately distinguish between texts written by native Japanese and English speakers.
Expected Outcome
The project aims to produce a functional model that can be used for Native Language Identification (NLI) in the context of Japanese learners of English. By extracting and analyzing linguistic features such as pronoun usage, the final model should be capable of accurately classifying texts based on the native language of the writer.

Challenges & Next Steps
Dimensionality Reduction: Applying PCA or other techniques to optimize the feature set for pronoun classification.
Model Training: Experimenting with different classification algorithms, starting with SVM, and fine-tuning model parameters for improved performance.
Evaluation: After training the model, it will be evaluated on test data to determine its accuracy and generalizability.
Future Directions
Expand the project to include more languages and generalize the model to identify native languages beyond just Japanese.
Incorporate advanced techniques such as BERT for context-aware embeddings and better handling of nuanced linguistic differences.
