Frequency Distribution Patterns:

Pronouns such as “he,” “she,” “it,” etc., show higher frequencies at lower TF-IDF values for native English speakers, suggesting these pronouns are commonly used in the English corpus.
In contrast, for native Japanese speakers using English, some pronouns (like “it,” “my,” and “you”) have higher TF-IDF values, indicating different usage patterns. These higher values might reflect how these pronouns are more concentrated in specific contexts for non-native speakers.
TF-IDF Value Distribution:

TF-IDF values range from 0 to 1. Low values indicate that the pronoun is frequently used across many contexts, while higher values suggest that the pronoun appears more selectively in specific contexts.
Pronouns like “you” and “it” for non-native speakers show higher TF-IDF values than for native speakers. This could be related to differences in language habits or sentence structures used by non-native speakers, especially those influenced by their first language (L1).
Pronoun Usage Differences:

Pronouns like “we” and “our” seem less frequently used by Japanese speakers. This might reflect differences in sentence structure or cultural preferences for group versus individual expression.
On the other hand, “you” is used more frequently by Japanese speakers, potentially indicating a preference for more direct forms of address in conversation or writing.
